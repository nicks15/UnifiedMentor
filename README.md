This project, completed as part of my internship at Unified Mentor, focuses on analyzing a furniture dataset to derive insights using data analysis and visualization techniques.

ðŸ”¹ Features:
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handles missing values, outliers, and standardizes data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Extracts meaningful patterns and trends from the dataset.
Visualization: Uses various plots and charts to showcase insights.
Statistical Analysis: Identifies key correlations and distributions in the dataset.
ðŸ”¹ Technologies Used:
Python
Pandas & NumPy (Data Manipulation)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)
Scikit-learn (Data Preprocessing, if applicable)
ðŸ”¹ How It Works:
Loads the furniture dataset and performs data cleaning.
Analyzes different attributes like price, material, type, and sales trends.
Visualizes key insights using various charts and graphs.
Derives conclusions and recommendations based on data trends.
